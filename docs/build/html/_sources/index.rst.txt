Welcome to legoBTLE4PI's documentation!
=======================================

This Project tries to provide a easy to use Python-API for connecting and controlling any Bluetooth-capable LEGO\ |reg|
Technics device and use it all on a Pi (i.e. Linux system).
The exclusive support for Linux was one requirement in the beginning, because:

1. There is a nice programming webpage out there made by LEGO\ |reg| - but that doesn't run for Linux
2. It should all be free and open software so that a large audience could hopefully be interest in such a project.

The following documents shall provide all information about the project.
